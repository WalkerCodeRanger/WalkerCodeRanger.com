	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I'm Jeff Walker.  I believe in creating <em>beautiful</em> code to solve
	<em>real</em> problems.  I've always dreamed of creating a successful
	software small business.  When I was in high school, I teamed up with a
	friend to create several small software products.  In the 10+ years I've
	been a professional software developer, I've always been thinking and planning
	what I might do with the help of my friend and three time co-worker
	<a href="http://www.FunnyAnt.com">Craig McKeachie</a>. Now, I'm hoping to
	really get going and <strong>share my insights on software craftsmanship and
	entrepreneurship</strong> on this <a href="/blog/" class="internal">blog</a>.</p>

	<p>I'm the creator of <a href="https://github.com/WalkerCodeRanger/RangerMask">RangerMask</a>,
	a flexible input masking library for the web.  I've made minor contributions to
	to open source projects such as
	<a href="https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator">FluentMigrator</a>.  In
	my professional career I've focused on .NET web applications. That has
	given me the opportunity to be part of a team creating large scale web applications
	with complex business logic.  </p>

	<p>To unwind, I play a lot of volleyball and read.  Mostly, I read non-fiction.
	I'm always looking for the next book that will change how I view the world
	and live my life.  I also like to watch Big Bang Theory and all sorts of movies,
	except horror.</p>
